						<h5>Cancellation by the Seller</h5>
						<p>There may be certain orders that a seller is unable to accept and Leykart has the right to cancel such orders. Leykart reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason whatsoever. Some situations that may result in a customer’s order being cancelled include, without limitation, non-availability of the product or quantities ordered by customer or inaccuracies or errors in pricing information. All such cancellation shall be without any recourse to the customer and without any liability to the seller or to Leykart.</p>
						<p>In the case of cancelled orders, the refund will be credited to the customer's bank account within 15 working days after deducting cancellation fees (if any).</p>
						<h4>REPLACEMENTS</h4>
					<ol>
					<li><p>Customers may refuse to accept an order from the delivery provider or choose to have the product opened and inspected before accepting the delivery, if the package appears to have been tampered with or damaged. In any of the above cases, the customer may contact Leykart customer care and place a request for replacement or cancellation.</p></li>
					<li><p>Once delivery is complete, an item is eligible for return or replacement only if it fulfils one or more of the following conditions:</p></li>
					<ul class="arrow">
						<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>The item was delivered in a physically damaged condition</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>The item has missing parts or accessories</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>The incorrect item was delivered </li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<li><p>In any of the above cases, the customer may contact Leykart customer care and place a request for replacement. The customer is requested to provide the Order Number and Sub Order Number along with images clearly depicting the damaged/missing/wrong product in the shipment. Thereafter, the customer will be contacted by an Ashok Leyland representative within 7 days to resolve the issue. </p></li>
					<li><p>The product should be returned unused and in the same condition as it was delivered, in its original box and packaging. The seller reserves the right to reject any return request if the product is not returned in its original packaging or the product appears used.</p></li>
					<li><p>Customers must log the product return or replacement request with Leykart customer care within 48 hours of receiving the order. Requests for return or replacement after this timeframe will not be entertained. Leykart will arrange the pick-up of the damaged/defective product through its logistics partner. In the event that Leykart is unable to do so, the customer will be notified accordingly. </p></li>
					<li><p>Once the returned goods have been duly accepted by the seller, the value of the goods, as originally paid by the customer will be refunded. Leykart will refund the amount using the same mode of payment as used during checkout. The refund will be processed within 15 days from the date of receipt and inspection of the returned goods.</p></li>
					<li><p>In case a customer is not available at the time of reverse pick-up, the logistics partner will make a maximum of 3 attempts to pick-up the shipment after which the customer must dispatch the product using a reputed courier service after consulting with Leykart customer care.</p></li>
					<li><p>An item can be replaced only once. If an item has been replaced once, it is not eligible for cancellation, return or another replacement.</p></li>
					<li><p>Leykart holds the sole right to deny cancellations, returns and replacements and is not obliged to justify the same.</p></li>
